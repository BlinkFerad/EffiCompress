EffiCompress: Efficient File Formatting Interface

EffiCompress is an advanced Python-based application engineered to optimize file compression across multiple formats, including OBB, RAR, and ZIP. This tool offers robust features such as password protection for secure file handling, the option to delete the original file post-compression, and a comprehensive view of recently modified files. Users can also decompile these files, although a password will be required if the file is encrypted. Currently, EffiCompress is in development, with plans for additional functionalities in future updates.
