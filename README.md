Warning: RAR Configuration Currently Unavailable

Please note that at the moment, RAR file compression functionality is not supported. If you attempt to compress files into a RAR format, the output will not be displayed or processed correctly. We recommend using ZIP or OBB formats for your compression needs. We apologize for any inconvenience and are working to improve this feature in future updates.

Also please note you do need to install python to access this.

EffiCompress: Efficient File Formatting Interface

EffiCompress is an advanced Python-based application engineered to optimize file compression across multiple formats, including OBB, RAR, and ZIP. This tool offers robust features such as password protection for secure file handling, the option to delete the original file post-compression, and a comprehensive view of recently modified files. Users can also decompile these files, although a password will be required if the file is encrypted. Currently, EffiCompress is in development, with plans for additional functionalities in future updates.
